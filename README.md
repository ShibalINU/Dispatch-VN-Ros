**Dispatch 🎮📟(C++ Text-Based Visual Novel)**

A narrative-driven, text-based **visual novel built entirely in C++**. The game follows Robert as he transitions from a frontline superhero to a behind-the-scenes dispatcher, with the story shaped entirely by player choices.

Across multiple scenes inspired by Episode 1 of Dispatch, players make key decisions that influence Robert’s morality, relationships, combat style, and eventual epilogue. The game uses classic C++ fundamentals—functions, Booleans, variables, and conditional logic—to create branching routes and dynamic story outcomes.

**This project serves as a compact, choice-heavy VN that explores character development through interactive storytelling while demonstrating core programming concepts in a simple console format. 📟**
